# lstm_matlab   
A matlab version of long short term memory   
The code is for the lstm model.   
The function of each file is listed as follows:   
lstmcellsetup.m: create a lstmcell layer for a Feedforword Backpropagate Neural Network.   
lstmcellff.m: performs a feedforward pass.   
lstmcellbp.m: performs backpropagation.   
lstmcellupdate.m: updates weights and biases with calculated gradients   
gradientTest.m: test wheather the gradients compute by lstmcellbp.m is right   
toyexample: toy example of the use of the code.
